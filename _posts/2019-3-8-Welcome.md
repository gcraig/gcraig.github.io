Welcome to CSR Development's blog reflecting on all sorts of interesting topics including: software, electronincs, writing, art, cochlear implants, astronomy, and various ways to improve life through technnology. These collection of posts will be a personal, less restrictive form of topics while Twitter's CSRDev account (twitter.com/CSRDev) will be geared towards the professional social media connection face of the organization. 

Let's hope to connect in a meaningful and rewarding manner. I hope we share as much we learn. Thanks for reading!
