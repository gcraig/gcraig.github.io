Welcome to our blog reflecting on all sorts of interesting topics including: software, electronics, writing, art, cochlear implants, astronomy, and many other ways to improve life through technnology. 

These posts will cover a broad range of subjects while Twitter's CSRDev account [twitter.com/@csrdevco](https://www.twitter.com/csrdevco) will be geared more towards the professional endeavor of the organization.

I hope we connect in a meaningful and rewarding manner. Sharing something important, returning the favor; we've learned so much from all of you. Thanks for reading.
