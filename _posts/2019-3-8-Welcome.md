Welcome to our blog, CSR Development's and mine, reflecting on all sorts of interesting topics including: software, electronics, writing, art, cochlear implants, astronomy, and any other way to improve life through technnology. 

These posts will cover a broader range of subjects while Twitter's CSRDev account [twitter.com/CSRDev](https://www.twitter.com/CSRDev) will be geared more towards the professional face of the organization.

I hope we connect in a meaningful and rewarding manner, sharing something important returning the favor as we've learned so much from all of you. Thanks for reading.

George
