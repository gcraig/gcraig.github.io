__Hello World!__

This is the first post to the blog for CSR Development - a more personal reflection on a number of topics - while Twitter.com/CSRDev will remain the professional social media connection to the organization. 

Let's hope we connect in a meaningful and rewarding manner. I hope to share as much as I learn. Thanks for reading!
